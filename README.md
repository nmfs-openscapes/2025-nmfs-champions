# 2025 NMFS Champions

Welcome to the 2025 NMFS Champions Program for NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS)! This is the website for the three NOAA Fisheries Cohorts running concurrently in Fall 2025 with research teams and individuals from across NMFS Centers and Offices. To learn more about what to expect
(the purpose, outcomes, and process of our Cohort) and to browse the
open lesson materials, please see the [Champions Program Lesson
Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series).

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where get our own work done at the same time
together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up
focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking
questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. We will make
breakout rooms so people working on related themes can meet and learn
from each other.

- **Dates:** TBD
- **Times:** TBD
- **Location:** remotely, via Zoom

## More about Openscapes and the Champions program:

- [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science
  tools**](https://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime/article) (Lowndes et
  al. 2017) - This describes a marine science team’s transition to open
  collaborative teamwork. It was the original inspiration for creating
  the Champions Program and heavily influences the Core Lessons. We’ll
  ask that everyone participating reads it before our first Cohort Call.
- [**Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data
  science**](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/)
  (Lowndes et al. 2019) - This was co-authored with the inaugural
  Champions Cohort, capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine
  and environmental science early career faculty.
- [**Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with
  Open
  Science**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341)
  (Lowndes et al. 2024) - This was co-authored by Openscapes mentors
  across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA,
  California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer
  Center.
