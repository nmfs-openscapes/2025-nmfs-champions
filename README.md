# 2025 NMFS Champions

Welcome to the 2025 NMFS Champions Program for NOAA Fisheries (National
Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS)! This is the website for the three NOAA
Fisheries Cohorts running concurrently in Fall 2025 with research teams
and individuals from across NMFS Centers and Offices. To learn more
about what to expect (the purpose, outcomes, and process of our Cohort)
and to browse the open lesson materials, please see the [Champions
Program Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series).

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where get our own work done at the same time
together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up
focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking
questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. We will make
breakout rooms so people working on related themes can meet and learn
from each other.

-   **Dates:** Tuesdays, Oct 14, 28, Nov 11, 25.
-   **Times:** 12:00 - 1:30 PT
-   **Location:** remotely, via Zoom

## More about Openscapes and the Champions program

-   [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science
    tools**](https://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime/article)
    (Lowndes et al. 2017) - This describes a marine science team’s
    transition to open collaborative teamwork. It was the original
    inspiration for creating the Champions Program and heavily
    influences the Core Lessons. We’ll ask that everyone participating
    reads it before our first Cohort Call.
-   [**Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data
    science**](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/)
    (Lowndes et al. 2019) - This was co-authored with the inaugural
    Champions Cohort, capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine
    and environmental science early career faculty.
-   [**Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with
    Open
    Science**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341)
    (Lowndes et al. 2024) - This was co-authored by Openscapes mentors
    across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries,
    EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch
    Cancer Center.
